## Overview

This project is based on the J P Morgan Global Finance and Business Management virtual experience.
The goal of the simulation was to analyze firm level financial performance, identify key cost and profitability drivers, and present insights in a format that supports faster and clearer decision making.

## Objectives

• Analyze firm level financial statements at scale
• Build structured financial models for profitability and variance analysis
• Create clear visual summaries for leadership style reporting
• Practice real world workflows used in finance and business management teams

## Data and Methodology

• Worked with firm level financial statement data covering revenue, costs, margins, and other key metrics
• Cleaned and structured the data in Excel to support comparison across business units and time periods
• Built models to evaluate profitability, variance against expectations, and major cost drivers
• Designed Tableau views to highlight trends, outliers, and performance shifts in a simple and interpretable way

## Key Contributions

• Analyzed more than one thousand firm level financial statements in Excel, creating profitability and variance models that reduced manual analysis time and helped surface high risk cost patterns across business units

• Built Tableau visualizations and leadership style summaries that reduced reporting effort, improved visibility into operational efficiency, and supported clearer and faster decision making for stakeholders

## Tools and Skills

• Excel for financial modeling, variance analysis, and structured calculators
• Tableau for interactive visualizations and performance reporting
• Analytical skills including trend analysis, variance explanation, and cost driver identification
• Business communication skills through concise written summaries and insight focused presentation structure

## What This Project Demonstrates

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real world style financial data, build practical models, and translate complex results into clear insights for business stakeholders.
The workflow and deliverables mirror the expectations of finance, strategy, and product analytics roles where data driven decisions and executive ready reporting are critical.
